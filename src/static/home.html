  This webpage started because I'm a retro nerd and craving a little nostalgia.
  I miss the way webpages were in the 90's. I wanted to be able to browse modern
  content updated on a regular basis and didn't have much luck with WRP. It was
  too much for my windows 3.11 box with IE5 or Nestcape 4.x. I don't run X on my
  linux boxes, but I do use framebuffer and I wanted to be able to view the same
  content in links (text or graphics mode). So i started with just grabbing the
  weather from weather.gov xml api and rendering it with basic html. I then
  added image caching/converting/resizing so that images could be viewed at a
  reasonable size for the smaller resolutions and of course those old browsers
  don't do png's. I then started adding RSS feeds and translating them to basic
  html.

  As it started to become something useable I thought that I might share. There
  of course is WRP and there is theoldnet.com, but WRP has to be run local and
  it kept crashing IE5 and Netscape 4.x for me, and theoldnet.com is old
  content. It just isn't the same as pulling up a website. The number of webites
  browseable by old browsers is dwindling daily, and sites with knowlege,
  hotwto, and downloadable scripts/utilities is the same. So here it is, a mix
  of new content that is proxied/translated to fit your screen, and some
  oldschool apps, utilities and documentation.

<p>This page will forever be under construction, hopefully.</p>
